## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript

### What I learned

- TypeScript, type safety helps me to improve error handling in applications
- TailwindCSS
- Dialog / Modal box, implemented by React Portal. We should instead use the third party library to ensure the correct behaviours of a dialog.
